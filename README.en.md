**An AI coding workflow for serious software engineering**

Tired of OpenSpec's flimsiness, Oh-My-OpenAgent's over-engineering, and Superpowers' fragmentation — I built a lightweight, **human-in-the-loop** AI harness from scratch.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable
```

One command to start working:

```bash
/cs-onboard
```

For daily use, when you don't know which skill fits, call the root entry:

```bash
/cs
```

`cs` reads your intent and tells you which `cs-xxx` to run.

If your agent supports automatic skill triggering, `using-codestable` checks for `.codestable/attention.md` in onboarded repositories and routes lifecycle tasks to `cs` by default. Features, bugs, refactors, architecture, requirements, roadmap work, audits, docs, decisions, learnings, code exploration, and workflow continuation no longer require typing `/cs` every time.

---

## Why

I was building a new harness agent ([MA](https://github.com/liuzhengdongfortest/MA)) — vibe-coding at first, just writing designs and requirements while AI wrote the code. It carried most features, until Codex repeatedly failed on a problem I thought was simple, making the same mistake in the same place. That's when I knew the project needed a workflow to keep moving.

I surveyed OpenSpec, SuperPowers, Oh-My-OpenAgent — none felt right:

- **OpenSpec** — too thin, no compounding, specs too abstract for humans to read
- **SuperPowers** — no process discipline, you never know which one to use
- **Oh-My-OpenAgent** — too heavy, philosophically treats "human intervention = failure"

CodeStable's goal is **to solve real software implementation and coding problems for serious engineering** — not to coin a new term or chase trends.

---

## The core difference: what gets orchestrated

Mainstream AI coding frameworks — Superpowers, CCW, Oh-My-OpenAgent — are all doing **the same thing**:

> **Orchestrating agents better.** Get them to team up, collaborate, brainstorm, run pipelines, hand off automatically. The entity at the center is always the **Agent**.

CodeStable goes the **other way**:

> **What gets orchestrated isn't agents — it's the lifecycle of the software itself.** The entities at the center are **the elements that make up software**: every requirement, every architectural decision, every feature, every bug, every constraint left in history.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Agent-orchestration camp</th><th>CodeStable</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Core entity</b></td><td>Agent / Role / Team</td><td>Requirement / Architecture / Feature / Issue / Decision</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Main question</b></td><td>How do agents divide work, hand off, coordinate?</td><td>How do requirements, constraints, decisions get recorded, retrieved, reused?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Where state lives</b></td><td>Agent sessions / message buses / queues</td><td>The <code>codestable/</code> file tree in your project (readable by both humans and AI)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Pain it solves</b></td><td>One agent isn't enough; need coordination to scale</td><td>Software complexity overflows context; tacit knowledge gets lost; requirements drift</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Role of humans</b></td><td>The less the better — full automation is the ideal</td><td>Human-in-the-loop — the programmer owns the whole; AI is an efficient executor</td></tr>
</table>

![](./asset/CodeStableVSAgent.png)

**Neither direction is wrong.**

If your task is "run an end-to-end automated pipeline with AI" or "have multiple agents debate a plan," the agent-orchestration camp fits better.

If your task is "maintain serious software that iterates over years" or "make sure a requirement written today can still be accurately recalled three months later" — then CodeStable's software-element-centric model fits better.

I built CodeStable because I believe **the chaos of software engineering isn't really about agents not being strong enough — it's about elements not being organized**. No matter how strong the agent, it can't save a project that's lost its requirements, architecture, and history.

## Design: 6 entities + 3 flows

CodeStable models real coding work as **6 entities** and **3 flows**.

### 6 entities

| Entity | Slug | What it does |
|------|------|--------|
| **Requirement** | requirements | Original user stories, the discussion and trade-offs at the time. The escape hatch — when code rots, you can throw it all out and let AI regenerate from these |
| **Architecture** | architecture | What the system's orchestration layer looks like to deliver the requirements. Concise, unified, **for humans to read** — not for AI to talk to itself |
| **Roadmap** | roadmap | "I want a permission system" — too big to throw at AI as a feature; cut it into a roadmap and advance step by step |
| **Feature** | feature | The actual engineering execution. Human and AI collaborate, jointly responsible for design / implementation / acceptance |
| **Issue** | issue | The bug list after release. AI and human solve it together |
| **Compound** | compound | The compounding-engineering knowledge base — pitfalls, good practices, technical decisions |

### 3 flows

| Flow | Key skill chain | Notes |
|------|------------|------|
| **Feature delivery** | `cs-feat` → `cs-feat-design` → `cs-feat-impl` → `cs-feat-accept` | Think it through → integrated design → step-by-step coding → acceptance. Whatever order suits you |
| **Issue fixing** | `cs-issue-report` → `cs-issue-analyze` → `cs-issue-fix` | Tell AI what's wrong → AI finds the root cause → AI fixes precisely |
| **Refactoring** | `cs-refactor` (beta) | Architectural rot doesn't happen overnight. AI assists, but **humans refactor**. Still iterating — feedback welcome |

## Workflow at a glance

CodeStable's skills aren't a single linear pipeline — they're **layered + event-driven**:

**How to read this diagram:**

- **Vertical = layers**, not strict time order — Layer 1 is refreshed repeatedly, Layer 2 is only entered for big needs
- **Layer 3 is event-driven**: new need → feature flow, bug → issue flow, rot → refactor flow
- **Cross-cut is the flywheel**: any flow can trigger a sink when something is worth keeping; the next round of work reads it back. This is the physical implementation of CodeStable's "compounding"

## Runtime structure

After `/cs-onboard`, a `codestable/` directory appears at your project root — the aggregate root for all CodeStable artifacts and the **only** workspace each skill reads/writes at runtime.

```

└── AGENTS.md                             # At project root, not under codestable/
```

**Key points:**

- All artifacts aggregate under `codestable/`, so "how did we handle that feature / bug last time" is three seconds away
- `requirements/` and `architecture/` are **long-lived archives** (current state only); `roadmap/` is the **planning layer** (what's next) — deliberately separated
- `features/` `issues/` `refactors/` use `YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}/` to bundle all related specs in one directory, no crossing
- `compound/` is the **single** knowledge sink directory — learning / trick / decision / explore are distinguished by the `doc_type` field, not by sub-directories. Easier to search
- `reference/` is copied in by `cs-onboard` from the skill package; to change shared conventions, edit the templates under `cs-onboard/reference/` — new projects pick up the new version on onboard

### Hard constraint

> A skill is an independent install unit. At runtime, **each skill can only see files inside its own package**. References like `B-skill/reference/xxx.md` written in skill A's SKILL.md are **simply unreachable** at runtime.
>
> Cross-skill shared references must go through the "working project" layer: `cs-onboard` copies them from the skill package to the project's `codestable/reference/`, and other skills read them via the project-relative path.

To change shared conventions, edit the templates under `cs-onboard/reference/`; new projects pick them up at onboard time.

---

## Design philosophy

CodeStable takes the **opposite** philosophy from OMO:

- OMO says: any human intervention is a failure signal
- CodeStable says: **the programmer is in the loop of software coding** — you may not understand the black-box implementation, but you must own the whole, and dive in when needed

Software architecture must be **evolvable**, **observable**, **controllable**.

This may matter less as AI gets stronger, but **right now this makes programmers comfortable in reality** — and that's the value.

CodeStable is modeled for real-world development scenarios, aiming to handle common dev problems through a closed-loop system. **Most existing frameworks model around AI, not around humans.** I think their authors have strong AI-driving skills but aren't seriously building software — they lack the basic ability to organize requirements and design, and they lack respect for code implementation.

---

## Roadmap

CodeStable adapts to model capability. If a future model nails a module reliably, that module gets removed.

- [ ] Refactor flow needs hardening (`cs-refactor` is still beta)
- [ ] …

Issues welcome — share your real-world dev pain and refactoring experience.
